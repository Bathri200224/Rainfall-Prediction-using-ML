# Rainfall-Prediction-using-ML
The project aims to build a machine learning model for predicting whether it will rain tomorrow or not. 
The dataset used for the project is the "weatherAUS.csv" file. 
The project involves several steps such as data ingestion, data preprocessing, feature encoding, feature scaling, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and training various machine learning models.
The data preprocessing steps include handling missing values using imputation, encoding categorical features using label encoding, and scaling numerical features using standardization. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets with a 80:20 ratio.
The project utilizes several machine learning models for classification, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Each model is trained and evaluated for accuracy using the testing set.
Finally, the accuracy scores of each model are compared, and it can be observed that KNN achieved the highest accuracy of 97.78%, followed by SVM with 82.93%Â accuracy.
